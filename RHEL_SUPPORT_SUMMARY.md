## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Package Manager Detection
- Detects `dnf` (preferred) or `yum` on RHEL systems
- Falls back gracefully for older systems
- Maintains compatibility with existing `apt` support

### 2. Package Name Mapping
- Comprehensive mapping between Debian and RHEL package names
- Handles version-specific packages (PHP, Python, Ruby)
- Supports development libraries and headers
- Maps service names appropriately

### 3. Service Management Abstraction
- Unified service management across distributions
- Automatic service name mapping (apache2 â†” httpd)
- Consistent systemctl usage across all systems

### 4. Repository Management
- RHEL-specific repository configuration
- EPEL repository integration
- Third-party repository support (Passenger, NodeSource)

### 5. Apache Configuration
- RHEL-specific Apache module loading
- Configuration file path mapping
- Module enablement differences handled

## Supported Distributions

### Debian-based (Existing)
- Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04 LTS
- Debian 11, 12

### RHEL-based (New)
- CentOS 7, 8, 9 (CentOS Stream)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9
- Rocky Linux 8, 9
- AlmaLinux 8, 9
- Fedora 38, 39, 40

## Package Manager Support

### Debian-based
- `apt` - Advanced Package Tool

### RHEL-based
- `dnf` - Dandified YUM (preferred)
- `yum` - Yellowdog Updater Modified (fallback)

## Installation Process

The installation process remains identical across all supported distributions:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhyreApps/PhyrePanel/main/installers/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

The installer automatically:
1. Detects the operating system
2. Selects the appropriate package manager
3. Downloads the correct installer script
4. Installs packages using the correct package manager
5. Configures services appropriately

## Testing

### Test Script
Run `php test-package-manager.php` to test package manager detection on your system.

### Manual Testing
Test on different distributions using Docker:

```bash
# CentOS Stream 9
docker run -it centos:stream9 bash

# Rocky Linux 9
docker run -it rockylinux:9 bash

# AlmaLinux 9
docker run -it almalinux:9 bash
```

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing Debian/Ubuntu installations continue to work unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Gradual migration path for users switching distributions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional RHEL Distributions**: Easy to add support for new RHEL-based distributions
2. **Arch Linux Support**: Framework ready for pacman support
3. **Package Caching**: Implement package caching for faster installations
4. **Custom Repositories**: Enhanced support for custom package repositories

## Migration Guide

For users migrating from Debian-based to RHEL-based systems:

1. Backup PhyrePanel configuration
2. Install PhyrePanel on new RHEL system
3. Restore configuration
4. Update any custom Apache configurations

## Support

- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/rhel-support.md`
- Test script for validation
- GitHub issues for bug reports
- Community support for questions

## Conclusion

PhyrePanel now provides true multi-platform Linux support, making it accessible to users across the entire Linux ecosystem. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while extending support to RHEL-based distributions, significantly expanding the potential user base and deployment options.
